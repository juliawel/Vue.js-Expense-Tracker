## What Did I Learn?

Vue.js Fundamentals: Gained hands-on experience with Vue.js features like ref, computed, and lifecycle hooks (onMounted);
State Management: Learned how to effectively manage component state and persist data using localStorage;
Form Handling: Worked with form inputs, utilizing v-model bindings, and implementing form submission using Vue's event modifiers;
LocalStorage Integration: Successfully implemented persistent data storage for transactions;
Toast notifications: Integrated toast messages for user feedback on actions performed within the app;
